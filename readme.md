# Weather App

Five day weather forecast sample app exercise

## Development

First run, any recent nodejs should be only prerequisite, `npm install` to get all required dependencies.

Start development server with `npm start` then view contents of www folder on localhost port 3000.

## Testing

... todo

## Deployment

Deploy with `push open shift ` command (requires authentication)/ssh access  then the contents of www will be ddeployed and available to browse here: http://weather-cloudbyte.rhcloud.com/

## Process

Velocity achieved: about 9 story points per 1 hour sprint...

This is detailed more fully in the docs: (./docs/sprint-planning.md)

I decided to try to emulate a business led approach to building requirements, by doing quick visual comparison of top weather sites and finding commonalities: [competitor analysis](./docs/analysis.md)

I made a basic wireframe design to have a clear requirement to work towards, and clearly communicate the intended goal up-front: [design and specification](./docs/design.md)

The code itself is fairly succinct (especialy as it's all contained in one file) and self explanatory, but also has comments to give insight into some choices: [index.html](./www/index.html)

... and for reference: [original requirements document](./docs/requirements.md)

## Outcomes

What I feel was demonstrated as part of this task includes:

1. Awareness of business led requirements
2. Rapid prototyping
3. Version control branch management (based on git-flow)
4. Nodejs/NPM core features (npm scripts/nodejs dev server)
5. Disciplined coding to tight deadlines
6. Task prioritisation in agile workflow
7. Basic of RESTful API 
8. Awareness of CSS frameworks
9. Awareness of responsive design like twitter bootstrap 
10. Awareness of CSS/design grid systems
11. Awareness of open shift paas platform 

Given more time, I would have liked to demonstrate:

1. knowledge of testing 
2. algorithmic proficiency
3. over a decade of dealing with browser incompatibiilty issues
4. can improve the GUI of the front page 
5. can demonstrate the weather hourly , daily bases with chart api
