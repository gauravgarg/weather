# Design and Specification

From analysis, there were some strong common threads, including display of location, date (as day names), summary icon graphic, temp/wind chart and summary data panel.

In order to be complient with contemporary standards and good practice, the design will be a mobile first, responsive design which gracefully degrades, and has accessibility features built in.

## Features

Single page app with location as title, split into two tabs for temperature and wind, with summary table below featuring graphic summary icons and daily summary data.
